A reworking of the Louisville Triple Crown of Running front page that I'm working on for my Code Louisville project

This project is my redesign of the front page for a local race series called the Louisville Triple Crown of Running.

The idea for this project came about because I got frustrated with the existing site (http://www.louisvilletriplecrown.com/) when looking for registration and date information.

Since I'm interested in pursuing UX design as a career, my aim was to create an improved user experience, putting the most important information front and center on the site.

If you look at the current version of the site, you have to go through multiple steps to find the dates of the races and pricing information. On my version, all that information is laid out in an easy-to-read format, at the top of the page. Other sections further down on the page link to important information like road closures and spectator directions.

The site is hosted on GitHub pages and can be found here:Â https://amytalbott.github.io/LTCORdesign/

To meet the requirements for the Code Louisville front end web development project, I did the following:

-Made the site responsive to different screen sizes by switching from a multi-column layout on larger screens to a one-column layout on smaller screens. On smaller screens, the navbar at the top collapses to a dropdown menu.

-Applied custom CSS rules to do things like position content within columns, add background images and colors, and add web fonts.

-Added comments in HTML, CSS, and JS files to note the purpose of each section of code

-Created this GitHub repository for the project

-Created this README file for the project

-Used jQuery to make photo overlay effects disappear, and make some text change in size when sections are hovered over
